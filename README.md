# Whatcha Going To-Do About It

## Description

Whatcha Going To-Do About It allows users to create to-do lists and allows for tasks
to be reordered using a simple drag and drop interface. Tasks can have an optional
date to be completed by, and can be marked completed with the click of a button.
All users have their own password protected boards.

Tasks are dynamically colored based on their status:

Default, not complete - blue
Complete - green
Due within 1 day - yellow
Past due date - red
